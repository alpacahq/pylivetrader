# This is an implementation of some of the stock-selection principles outlined here:

# No guarantees are provided about the performance of these principles as described

# with backtesting and forward testing before committing to its use.

# This algorithm select stocks from several sectors that fit its criteria for being a
# safe investment - it looks for companies who have relatively small PE and PB ratios,
# positive earnings per share, a dividend of at least 1%, and manageable near-term and
# long-term debt loads.

# It weights its investments in the stocks it finds by market cap, but such that each
# sector (with at least one acceptable stock) has an even amount of cash dedicated to it
# overall. It rebalances its selections and cash allocations once every three months.
