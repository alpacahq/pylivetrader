# Example Portfolio Manager

Rather than executing trades based on market conditions, this example enforces a configurable set of rules on your portfolio using pylivetrader. In particular, it does the following: sets a maximum time that orders can remain open, sets stop-loss and profit-taking levels, and sets a maximum percentage of your portfolio that a single position may occupy. You can see here how to use `get_open_orders()` and the `context.portfolio` view to monitor your positions in relation to your portfolio as a whole.
